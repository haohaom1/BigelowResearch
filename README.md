> Modelling the effect of Kelp on Ocean Chemistry and Mussel Growth

This is the research I did for Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, working closely with Professor Bruce Maxwell and Dr. Nichole Price

> Summary

Rising atmospheric CO2 has caused increased levels of CO2 in seawater, which can damage the strength of shellfish shells during the growth phrase. It has been hypothesized that by planting kelp in the vicinity of the shellfish, photosynthetic activity will create a halo of lower CO2 levels around the kelp farm, which can help the mussels grow at a faster pace. My job is to model the data collected from boating trips to evaluate the change.
